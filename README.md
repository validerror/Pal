# Problem To Solve
* Can't put 'timerTV' above the VideoView and I dont know how to fix, when it comes to 'ImageView' it works prefect. End in can't display the clock when you in a video.
* Small Memory Leak, I haven't work with LeakCanary so this may caused by the bitmap in recyclerViewAdapter. I'll fix it later.

# Progress
* Problem 1: It turns out the problem caused by the layoutParam in the LandScape FrameLayout.  
when it's LandScape, widget can't be assigned correctly except Gravity_Bottom. Still confused.
